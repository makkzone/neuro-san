                to the coded tool and whose values are the values passed for them
                by the calling agent.  This dictionary is to be treated as read-only.

                The argument dictionary expects the following keys:
                    utc_offset: An integer representing the UTC offset in hours.
                    iana_timezone: A string representing the IANA timezone name.

        :param sly_data: A dictionary whose keys are defined by the agent hierarchy,
                but whose values are meant to be kept out of the chat stream.

                This dictionary is largely to be treated as read-only.
                It is possible to add key/value pairs to this dict that do not
                yet exist as a bulletin board, as long as the responsibility
                for which coded_tool publishes new entries is well understood
                by the agent chain implementation and the coded_tool implementation
                adding the data is not invoke()-ed more than once.

                    None

            In case of successful execution:
