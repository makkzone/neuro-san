    Singleton factory for providing client access to OpenFGA server.

    (DEFAULT_STORE_NAME) for all the threads, but we will want all the threads
    to have their own client.

    In testing, however, we have the opposite: multiple stores for (likely)
    single threaded tests so that they specifically do not stomp on anything
    real code would use.
