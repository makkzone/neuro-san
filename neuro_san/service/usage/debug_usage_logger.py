    Implementation of the UsageLogger interface that merely spits out

        Logs the token usage for external capture.

        :param token_dict: A dictionary that describes overall token usage for a completed request.

                For each class of LLM (more or less equivalent to an LLM provider), there will
                be one key whose value is a dictionary with some other keys:

                Relevant keys include:
                    "completion_tokens" - Integer number of tokens generated in response to LLM input
                    "prompt_tokens" - Integer number of tokens that provide input to an LLM
                    "time_taken_in_seconds" - Float describing the total wall-clock time taken for the request.
                    "total_cost" -  An estimation of the cost in USD of the request.
                                    This number is to be taken with a grain of salt, as these estimations
                                    can come from model costs from libraries instead of directly from
                                    providers.
                    "total_tokens" - Total tokens used for the request.

                More keys can appear, but should not be counted on.
                The ones listed above contain potentially salient information for usage logging purposes.

        :param request_metadata: A dictionary of filtered request metadata whose keys contain
                identifying information for the usage log.
        """
