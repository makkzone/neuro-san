        # The preferred way of extending the library to use your own LLM classes.
        # The idea here is that this is a table of class names -> LlmPolicy class types
        # that your factory will use.
        #
        # LlmPolicy classes allow for a few methods for control over creating and cleaning up
        # BaseLanguageModel instances over the course of their lifetime within the neuro-san system.
        #
        #   * create_llm() actually creates your BaseLanguageModel instance
        #           from a fully-specified llm config that is compiled by the system.
        #           "Fully-specified" here means that the config is a product of llm_config
        #           settings for any given agent in an agent network hocon file overlayed
        #           on top of the default settings you specify in your own llm_info.hocon file.
        #   * delete_resources() deletes any resources related to network clients that were
        #           created by create_llm(). Unfortunately, most often this involes reaching
        #           into the internals of your particular BaseLanguageModel implementation
        #           in order to shut down any network connections.  This isn't strictly required,
        #           but it's highly recommended in a server environment.
        #   * create_client() creates a network client that can be used to make requests
        #           to your LLM.  This is only required if your BaseLanguageModel implementation
        #           can take some kind of externally instantiated web client as an argument to
        #           its constructor and you care about delete_resources() cleanup.
        #
        # See neuro_san.internals.run_context.langchain.llms.llm_policy.LlmPolicy and some
        # of the base implementations near there for more details/examples.
