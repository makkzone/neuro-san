class AgentProgressReporter:
    """
    An interface for CodedTools to be able to report on an agent network's progress.

    Instances get handed down via the CodedTool's arguments dictionary via the
    "progress_reporter" key via the invoke() or async_invoke() methods.

    Typically, progress is reported as a dictionary that is JSON-serializable
    and interpreted by the client on a per-agent-network basis in the structure.
    The simplest and most easily interpreted structure is simply to report a key of "progress"
    with a value of a float between 0.0 and 1.0, but other keys/values can be used to report
    (say) partial progress on a structure that is being built by the agent network so that it
    can be visualized by an in-the-know client.

    Text messages can also be sent as content, but more as differential comments.
    These are not recommended, as any given client may not be able to parse them very easily.
